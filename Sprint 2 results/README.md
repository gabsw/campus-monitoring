# Sprint 2 Assessment - 28/11/2019

## Achievements

1. Data streaming pipeline is complete. However, at the moment, all data is being generated by simulated sensors.
2. Infrastructure orchestration is complete (PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, adapters, collectors and main app).
3. Weather Reading API feature.
4. Weather Stats API feature.

## Missing

1. Frontend is still not integrated with the application.

## Example requests

To test the application's REST API, you can use Postman with the provided examples in `postman_requests`.

Just import the collections on Postman and make sure that you can access UA's internal network.

These requests cover all currently implemented features.
