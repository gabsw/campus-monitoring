# Sprint 3 Assessment - 12/12/2019

## Achievements

1. Real data generated by Raspberry Pi B3 with BME680 sensor. The sensor is located at a home office with 30 m2 with air conditioning. The data is being sent to the team's DB in the VM. 

Query DB: 

	SELECT * FROM
	campus_monitoring.WEATHER_READING As wr
	JOIN campus_monitoring.SENSOR AS se
	ON wr.sensor_id = se.id
	WHERE se.local_name = 'Escritorio Gabriela'


The scripts found in `Sensor` are not the latest ones running on RaspberryPi and the helper machine that is sending the data to the VM to work around UA's VPN system, still have to be updated on GitHub.

2. Universal Alarms API feature with e-mail notification.
3. Report API feature - reports on alarms stats.
4. Review API feature.


## Missing

1. Login feature (Predicted Finish Date: 17/12/2019)
2. Frontend is still not integrated with the application. (Predicted Finish Date: 19/12/2019)


## Example requests

To test the application's REST API, you can use Postman with the provided examples in the folder `postman_requests`.

Just import the collections on Postman and make sure that you can access UA's internal network.

These requests cover all currently implemented API features.
